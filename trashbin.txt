The travelling salesman problem (TSP)
 
also known as the travelling salesperson problem

    2. Help design and test the effect of traffic infrastructure (e.g. road, building etc.)
 
Common Application of Traffic Simulation 
    1. Design and test the effect of traffic infrastructure (e.g. road, building etc.)
 
hich enables planners to use available budgets and resources as efficiently as possible when expanding 
    or reconstructing transportation systems.

* What are the best measures to reduce traffic-related emissions? 
* How can traffic be managed safely for all road users? 
* How to choose between a roundabout or adaptive traffic lights to guarantee a good traffic flow? 
* How to coordinate public transport service with smooth traffic operations?  
* What impact will new technologies like autonomous driving have on the network?
 
Also AirBag from Radiohead OK Computer is a cool song.
