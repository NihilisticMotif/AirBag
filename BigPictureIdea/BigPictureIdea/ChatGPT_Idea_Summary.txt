Idea 
1. Traffic Prediction 
* Predict bottlenecks, peak traffic times, accidents, road closures etc. 
* Use data from GPS data, traffic cameras, Google Maps, Grab etc.
2. Improve Traffic Light System 
3. Collect traffic data and driver report from user app.
4. Improve public transportation system e.g. routes, schedules, and frequency
5. Predict the demand of public transportation 
6. Simulations for Urban Planning
* Create simulations that show how different infrastructure and policy changes (e.g., new roads, bike lanes) might affect traffic.
7. Analyze the relationship between traffic patterns and air pollution (e.g. PM2.5 etc.).
8. Find the path that have less traffic congestion for the user.
