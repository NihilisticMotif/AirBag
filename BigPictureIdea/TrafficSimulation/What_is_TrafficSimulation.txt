What is a traffic simulation?
* A traffic simulation is a virtual replica of real traffic scenarios. 

Purpose
    Traffic simulation help design and test the effect of traffic infrastructure (e.g. road, building etc.).
    It helps provide some answer for the following questions 
    which enables planners to use available budgets and resources as efficiently as possible when expanding 
    or reconstructing transportation systems.
        * What are the best measures to reduce traffic-related emissions? 
        * How can traffic be managed safely for all road users? 
        * How to choose between a roundabout or adaptive traffic lights to guarantee a good traffic flow? 
        * How to coordinate public transport service with smooth traffic operations?  
        * What impact will new technologies like autonomous driving have on the network?

3 Types of Traffic Simulation 
    1. Macroscopic simulation 
        * It considers only grouped traffic flow volumes.
    2. Mesoscopic simulation
        * It is based on individual agents, their average speed and grouped traffic flow volumes.
    3. Microscopic simulation
        * It is based on individual agents, their average speed and grouped traffic flow volumes
          and how each individual agents react to the situation in continuous time.
