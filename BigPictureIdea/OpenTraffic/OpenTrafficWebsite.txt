DESCRIPTION (https://datacollaboratives.org/cases/opentraffic.html)
    The World Bank, Conveyal, and Mapzen formed the nonprofit OpenTraffic to support open source software development and collect accurate, 
    real-time traffic data from individuals and organizations across the transport sector. 
    By partnering with transport organizations around the world, OpenTraffic is able to access and pool this anonymized traffic data to 
    create a complete dataset of traffic and routing data available free to the public. 
    This data intends to support community planning and businesses decision-making, 
    in addition to providing the public with access to high-quality traffic data.
