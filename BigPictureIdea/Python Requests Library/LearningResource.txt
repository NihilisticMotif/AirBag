The Overpass API is a read-only API that serves up custom selected parts of the OSM map data. It acts as a database over the web.

OSM uses basic data structures
1. node
* Nodes also save a latitude and longitude, indicating where the node is located on the world.
2. way
* Ways contain a list of the nodes
3. relation. 
* Relations are groups of nodes, ways and relations defining a logical relationship for this elements, 
  for example being part of the same street, neighbourhood, city, postal code area, etc.
Each element can have multiple tags, which consist of a key-value pair and they help specify the features of each element.

If we go to https://www.openstreetmap.org/, right-click on some point of the map and then click on Query Features, 
we get a list of the elements of the area. 

We can query the information from OpenStreetMap using Overpass QL. There are 3 possible query outputs
1. xml 
    * Default
2. json 
    * we need to add [out:json] in front of it
3. csv 
    * we need to define the list of columns for it to work.

There are 2 main ways to use Overpass in Python
1. Requests library
* Overpass Python Tutorial: https://towardsdatascience.com/loading-data-from-openstreetmap-with-python-and-the-overpass-api-513882a27fd0
```
import requests

overpass_url = 'https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter'
overpass_query = '''
[out:json];
area[name="ZÃ¼rich"][place="city"];
node[amenity="toilets"](area);
out;
'''

response = requests.get(overpass_url, params={'data': overpass_query})
```
```
import overpass 
api = overpass.API(endpoint="https://overpass.myserver/interpreter", timeout=25)
```
