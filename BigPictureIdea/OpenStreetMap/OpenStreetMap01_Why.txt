Why OpenStreetMap ?
    1. Geographical data (geo data) is not free in many parts of the world. 
    2. Close source data might not correct, but most people cannot correct it.
    3. You cannot get the data. Photocopy might be illegal.
    4. You cannot share your close source data to anyone without money.
    5. Cheap GPS help you create your own open source maps.

How can a project like this create accurate maps?
    1. By the very nature of the wiki-style process there is no guarantee of accuracy of any kind. Then again, few proprietary maps carry a guarantee of accuracy, either.
    2. If one person puts in inaccurate data, maliciously or accidentally, the other 99.9% of people can check it, fix it, or get rid of it.
    3. It can be difficult to weed out the inevitable errors.
    4. There is a History tab on the main page that shows recent edits to the selected area.

    5. One way is to pick an area that you know well and use the OpenStreetMap viewer to see how well the map data corresponds to your own knowledge.

You seem to have a lot of existing map data. Where did it come from?
    * In areas where there are no such data sources (most areas) we have to start from a blank slate, and head out there to survey the streets ourselves.

Why is the data sometimes inconsistent?
    1. OpenStreetMap is a free editable map of the whole world. It is made by people like you.
    2. The fact that the data is open source and any one can edit it, allow the data to be upated.
