What images and maps may I use to make maps from?
    Message
    1. Most maps have copyright restrictions.
    2. You should not use copyrighted maps in any way while editing OpenStreetMap (unless it is compatible with our license).

    3. So what can you use? Not very much, which is why we are doing all this re-surveying from scratch.
    4. However OSM has permission to use some datasources including imported TIGER data in the USA, AND Data in the Netherlands, and recent aerial imagery from Bing and Mapbox.

I have just made some changes to the map. How do I get to see my changes?
    1. The "standard" map appearing on OpenStreetMap.org tends to be updated after a couple of minutes, but can also be longer depending on server load
    2. Depending on your browser, you can try to 'force reload/refresh' the content. Check your software for the key combination (Ctrl+F5 and⇧ Shift+Ctrl+R are common).

    3. If your data is still not appearing and you are pretty sure that the one or the other renderer has done its job, then you might have a tagging problem. Check that 
       * Run JOSM validator or, if edit is old, check area on Osmose. Or use other QA tool
       * all your ways are tagged with something appropriate that will be rendered (e.g. highway=tertiary). However, do not tag an object with unsuitable tags just to get it shown on a specific map.
       * your tags are in lower case: highway instead of HIGHWAY or Highway.
       * you use an underscore “_” instead of a space in tags such as highway=bus_stop

Do I need to own a GPS device to contribute to the map?
    1. No.
    2. GPS devices were therefore useful to determine the position of roads and other map features. 
    3. GPS devices were therefore useful to determine the position of roads and other map features. 
    4. You can still upload your GPS track logs (also called traces) to OpenStreetMap

What GPS should I buy? Can I use a "satnav" in-car unit?
    * Some in-car units will generate the tracklogs that OSM use, but you must make sure you turn off the "Snap to Road" option

I have public domain non-GPS data, how can I upload it?
    * If you have public domain data obtained from non-GPS sources (for example, a municipality's public information website), it may be suitable for importing.

Why is the satellite imagery low resolution? Is there other satellite imagery that I can use that has more detail? Can you update it? How often is it updated?
    * The Aerial Imagery is from a variety of sources that we have permission to use – Bing is the most popular worldwide and have the largest coverage.
    * OSM neither controls nor owns the satellite imagery, so we cannot request updates.

What shall I do for roads that have multiple values for a tag?
    1. Where different tag values apply to different sections of a road, we always split the road up into several ways.
    2. If you worry about how to represent the whole length of road, you might look at using relations to re-group ways.
    3. If you have multiple different values for the same key, applying to the same element, then you may need to use the semi-colon value separator. For example, nat_ref=B500;B550.

Another user has changed something I edited. I think they're wrong. How do I contact them?
    1. On one of the map layers on OpenStreetMap.org, zoom in and click the query features button button to enter query mode. 
    2. In iD (the in-browser editor), select the object and click on "View in OpenStreetMap" at the bottom left.

How do I track edits of a region?

How to remove an object from the map?
    * If a physical object (e.g. a building) does not exist and is not visible on the latest aerial or satellite imagery, simply remove it.
    * If a physical object (e.g. a building) has been recently demolished, it can be removed, but it is good practice to change the tags, for example, from [building] to [demolished:building=yes]. Such a building will no longer be visible on the map, but this will ensure that someone who maps from satellite imagery will not add it again.
