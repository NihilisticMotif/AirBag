Introduction 
    * The Overpass API is a read-only API that serves up custom selected parts of the OSM map data. 
      It acts as a database over the web.
    * It is used as data base of many service.

Quick Start (60 seconds): for Developers/Programmers

The Programmatic Query Language (OverpassQL)

Public Overpass API instances
    * To support small and well scaling OSM main services, Overpass API is run as a third party service.

Community: where can I get help?
    1. Note that Overpass Turbo is documented separately to the Overpass API itself.
    2. The Overpass API documentation isn't searchable and won't actually help you much unless you are already very familiar with the Overpass API itself.
    3. There are several community sites providing help for Overpass API and overpass turbo related questions. 
    4. If you ask a question on a real-time help site such as IRC or Slack, then obviously you'll get an up to date answer.
    5. Only the IRC and OSM Help links are managed by the OSM community - the other sites are controlled by third parties.

Limitations
    1. Download big data 
    * The size of an Overpass API query result is only known when the download is complete.
    * The dynamically generated files from Overpass API typically take longer to generate and download than downloading existing static extracts of the same region.
    * It is better to use Planet.osm than Overpass API to extract country-sized regions with all (or nearly all) data in it.
    * Overpass API is most useful when the amount of data needed is only a selection of the data available in the region.
    2. Querying of OSM data history
    * Overpass API doesn't offer changeset-based criteria. It's possible to work around that, by using time-based diffs, but this may be clumsy.
    3. Database lag
    * It can take a couple of minutes for changes to the database to show up in the Overpass API query results.
