What is OpenStreetMap ?
    * Technically, OpenStreetMap is a database, and not what everyday language calls a 'map'. There are many software applications, known as editors, that can be used to edit the database.

Introduction
    * The OpenStreetMap License allows free (or almost free) access to our map images and all of our underlying map data. 

The Map 
    * The map is widely used, but it isn't finished yet.

Mapping 
    Message
    * We are getting out from behind our computer screens, and surveying towns and countryside to create our maps
    * If you have a GPS unit you can contribute any tracks you have recorded.
    * We are also able to derive maps from Bing aerial imagery or other mapping techniques. 
    * You can start editing our maps straight away using the online "iD" editor, or download the JOSM desktop application.

Development 
    * There is opportunity for subprojects that work with or use our data, but we also need help fixing bugs and adding features to our core components.
